                I got bored and decided to make a tool which helped you memorize characters.
                <br>
                Now, that isn't this tool; what happened is that I got bored <i>again</i> and made another version.

                <h2>What was the old version like?</h2>
                It was basically the same thing, except with in C# on the console-- it was just white text on a black background.
                <br>
                If you want to download it, it's avalable <a href="../FTP/Hiragana_Teacher_v1.5.exe">here.</a>

                <h2>Does it work?</h2>
                Meh, probably.
