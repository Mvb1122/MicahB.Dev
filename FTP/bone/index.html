<p>I, Thaddeus Melchizedek Bone, have been caught up in a whirlwind of lies and slander, for the world is desperate to turn me into a woman. To this end, my very soul has faced ceaseless bombardment with the word "egg".</p>

<p>The specter of transgenderism now haunts every aspect of my life. For all of my life I had been a model of masculinity, a man of tremendous character and masculine fortitude. Ergo I was a prime target. The Central Intelligence Agency first began its campaign on Discord. A friend of pre-existing transgender convictions invited me to a "trans-fem" server. From there the Cult of the Egg was born.</p>

<p>Upon my entry in the "trans-fem" server the members, evidently threatened by my hyper-masculine character, began to bombard me with constant accusations of being a "transgender egg". Anything and everything I said was wielded as a weapon against me. Many times have I tried to understand and find common ground the trans-feminine experience and culture only for my words to be fashioned as arrows at my manhood. When I complimented the outfits of users in the server, tried out the name Petunia, and inquired about the laws relating to the sale of estrogen, instead of being applauded for my solidarity and kinship was reprimanded for being an "egg".</p>

<p>From there, as the egging ramped up, the thoughts  of becoming a woman grew ceaseless and intrusive. At this point, for the sake of guarding my manhood, I knew I needed to escape Discord. This is when it the campaign seeped into my personal life. One day, when I was at the store, shopping for clothes, I accidentally stumbled into the women's section. At this point, a transgender woman (whom only now do I realize was an agent) turned around, pointed her finger at me and cried "Egg!" Then the entire store stopped in its tracks and followed her lead, chanting "Egg! Egg! Egg!" until I was forced to run out, tears streaming down my face. </p>

<p>When I drove home from the store, I hardly noticed the car parked across the street until I went to unlock the door and heard shots. I ducked. When I got up, I saw three darts lodged in the front door. Forensic analysis determined that each of these darts contained a high dosage of estrogen.</p>

<p>This criminal transgender conspiracy has brought sheer terror to my life. The pink cloud casts its shadow over everything. This threat of this feminine campaign has forbidden me from doing anything apart from staying home and watching Onimai. Because of this, I urge you to write to your Congressman in support of H.R. 42069, the Anti-Forcefem Act of 2024, also known as Samhain's Law.</p>
