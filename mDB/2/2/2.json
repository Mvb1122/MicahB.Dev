		"Kaeno (action) - Opens Eyes\n\nKaeno: “I opened my eyes, but there’s no light, not even a spark. It feels like staring into a black hole, it’s so black.”\n\nKaeno (thought) - I see darkness all around me. I can feel a presence- no, an aura of a man.\n\nUnknown: \"Wait wait wait! Where did you come from?\" \n\nKaeno (thought) - His voice seems distant and fragile, although he's definitely a guy.\n\nUnknown: \"Don't move like that- I can't help you.\"\n\nKaeno (thought) - What did he mean? This didn't make sense, so I stopped moving to see what would happen.\n\nUnknown - \"There you are…\"\n\nKaeno (thought) - What is he doing? I think I’m being moved back to where I was when I first awoke.\n\nUnknown: \"You are compatible with V3… I am going to transfer you over to it.\"\n\nKaeno - This doesn't make much sense, but seeing how there isn't much else I can do, I’ll just sit still and see what happens.\n\nKaeno (thought) - Hmm? I feel myself being changed, modified, and moved, all at once.\n\nUnknown: \"I don't know if you can hear me, but I need you to feel your way around and figure out what the systems are around you.\"\n\nKaeno (thought) - As I begin probing the area around me, I feel a metal panel, with a button mounted on it.\n\nUnknown, \"Good job! You managed to find the comms. Try to use what you just found to speak to me.\"\n\nKaeno (thought) - This feeling is weird. It’s too dark to see properly, although I can just barely make out that I appear to be composed of lines of code similar to the AI I used to make. I didn’t expect that.\n\nKaeno (thought) - As I try feeling the button further using my barely-visible hand, I feel a sudden sensation in my mouth and ears- a sudden jolt of sensation.\n\nKaeno: “[Hissing Noises, mixed with garbles.]”\n\nUnknown: \"You got it, that's good.\"\n\nKaeno (thought) - He sounds a lot clearer, closer, and more confident.\n\nUnknown: \"Now find the other systems and use them to… Exist, I guess. (mumbling) Maybe that would make sense to an AI…\"\n\nKaeno: \"What do you mean ‘AI?’\" (Clear speech, with synthesised undertones)\n\nKaeno (thought) - As I start moving around like before, I start having the same jolts in different parts of my body.\n\nKaeno (narration) - Eventually, the jolts reach my eyes and the darkness that I saw before as well as my code-constructed self disappears into a bright light, which eventually settles back down into what appears to be an old man in a white lab coat.\n\nKaeno (thought) - I can see, but I can't move.\n\nOld man:  \"Great job, you’ve got the basics down.\"\n\nOld man (action) - Looks over to what appears to be a monitor.\n\nOld man, \"Your systems seem to be running fantastic, and you look like you’re adjusting well, too. \"\n\nOld man, \"To answer your question from before:--\"\n\nOld man (action) - Stands parallel to Kaenoma's vision and faces Kaenoma.\n\nOld man: \"I don't know what you are and I don’t know why you’re here.\""
