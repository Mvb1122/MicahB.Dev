After one's Discord username is altered to approximate their real name, it must be kept. 
One must not have more than one account, under their ownership, within the server. 
If one has lost their account, they may replace it, so long as they relink their account, provided that it was linked beforehand.

Language appropriate to the situation must be used within this platform.
