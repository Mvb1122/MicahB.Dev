                &emsp;Ah, Engines. The mysterious things which drive us to school, work, and home every day.
                But how do they work (as <b>specifically</b> relates to physics)? 
            </div><br>
            <div>
                &emsp;In thermodynamics, an engine consists of three main parts:
                <ul>
                    <li>The <b>Hot Reservoir</b>, which provides energy.</li>
                    <li>The <b>Heat Engine</b>, which converts heat into <b>work</b>&#8212; usable energy.</li>
                    <li>The <b>Cold Reservoir</b>, which sinks unused, <b>inefficient</b> energy into the environment.
                </ul>
                In case that's hard to understand, here's a diagram:
                <br>
                <div class="center">
                    <img src="./Engine_Images/Heat Engine Diagram.svg" alt="A diagram of a heat engine." class="FitImage">
                </div>
                <br>
            </div><br>
            <div>
                &emsp;Historically, engines have been quite important to society's evolution. For instance, take the Steam Engine.
                This wonderful invention catapulted humanity from being a bunch of bugs on a rock to being an industrialized powerhouse.
                Steam Engines were the first <b>meaningful</b> (don't forget waterwheels) forms of engines. Within a Steam Engine, coal is used to heat fire, such that water forms a <b>hot reservoir</b>, and then the pressure generated by the Steam within the engine is used to perform <b>work</b>, before being vented into the atmosphere, which forms the <b>cold reservoir</b>.
            </div><br>
            <div>
                &ensp;However, let's take a closer look at normal, everyday <b>gas engines</b>. In a gas engine, gasoline is pumped into a cylinder, whereupon it's compressed. Then, once compressed as much as possible, a spark plug ignites it. Since this turns the gasoline <b>from a solid into a gas</b>, its density <b>decreases</b> and thus pressure <b>increases</b>. Finally, the pressure upwards is used to perform work, while the fumes are vented out into the atmosphere.
                In this example, the gasoline's unlit <b>chemical energy</b> forms the <b>hot reservoir</b>, the piston extracts <b>work</b> (and thus acts as the <b>Heat Engine</b>) and the atmosphere forms the <b>cold reservoir</b>. However, and remember this for later: because the gasoline is ignited <b>by a spark plug</b>, the efficiency is lower, since not all of the gasoline might be ignited.

                &ensp;Something to note is the processes that the gas is under throughout ignition:
                <ol>
                    <li><b class="red">AB</b>: At first, the gas is drawn in via an <b>isochoric process</b>, where the volume remains constant. During this, pressure might dip as it's almost literally <b>sucked into</b> the cylinder.</li>
                    <li><b class="red">BC</b>: Once in the cylinder, the piston comes down and compresses the gas in an <b>isothermal</b> process, where its pressure goes up while its volume goes down. Finally, there's a <b>spark</b>, and the gas ignites!</li>
                    <li><b class="red">CD</b>: Once lit, the gas is under an <b>adiabatic</b>, where the gas expands, while its pressure remains constant. (In this case, the pressure drives the piston up.) The temperature also declines a bit.</li>
                    <li><b class="red">DA</b>: Finally, the gas cools and is pumped out in another <b>isochoric process</b>.</li>
                </ol>

                All in all, here's an animation of that process, accompanied by the gas's Pressure vs Volume graph:
                <br>
                <div class="center">
                    <video src="./Engine_Images/engine.mp4" alt="An animation of an engine." class="FitImage" autoplay muted loop></video>
                </div>
                <br>
                Keep in mind that this animation is pretty rough; that graph is pretty much an educated guess at the end. The other thing to note is that a combustion engine actually does a <b>non-reversible process</b>; the gas can't be un-combusted, after all.

            <div>
                "But what about the future? Aren't <b>Electric</b> and <b>Diesel</b> engines going to save us from climate change?" I hear you ask. 
                <br><br>First, let's examine Diesel engines:<br><br>

                &ensp;In a <b>diesel engine</b>, the fuel isn't ignited by a spark, but rather by the <b>immense</b> pressures generated by the piston pressing down on the gas. (Look, see! I said it'd come back later!) Because of this, it's less complicated and tends to be more efficient. <b>Additionally</b>, diesel engines use diesel fuel instead of gasoline&#8212; because diesel is more power-dense, this also helps with power generation and fuel efficiency, too. 
                
                <br><br>

                Next, in electric engines: <br><br>
                &ensp;For electric engines, rather than it being <b>chemical energy</b>, it's <b>electric potential energy</b> which is converted, not via internal combustion, but via a <b>motor</b>, to work. In an electric engine, a few additional challenges are faced:
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintaining an electric charge; is it from a typical internal combustion generator? Or is it from a battery? Maybe even both? How much <b>mass</b> do either of those add? What about <b>cost</b>?</li>
                    <li>Figuring out how many motors to use, and if so, in what configuration; is there one motor connected to a transmission? Or is there one motor for each wheel? How does this effect <b>costs</b>?</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                One final thing to think about for electric cars is the vast diffference in efficiency between them and typical combustion engines; where a Disel engine might effectively use about <b>30%</b> of the energy in its fuel, and Gasoline engines use about <b>25%</b>, <b>an electric car can effectively use up to 100%!</b><br>
                (Note that it's not actually 100%, because it's impossible, but you get the point! It's <b>really</b> efficient!)<br>
                &ensp;This is because electric cars can utilize <b>regenerative breaking</b> to turn kinetic energy back into electric potential energy when stopping; a source which is usually turned into heat by a conventional car's breaks. Secondarily, because electric cars also use electric motors (duh!) instead of combustion engines, the waste heat produced is a lot lower. Electric cars also have a lot of other benefits, like being quieter and more convenient because they can be refueled (so to say) at home, rather than having to go to a gas station. Some electric cars can even be charged on normal household wall outlets!
